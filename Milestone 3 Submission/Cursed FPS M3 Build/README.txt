Objective:

Your goal in Cursed Halo is to use some strange, weird weapons to kill the other "players!"
The first player to 15 kills wins, no teams- it's a free for all.

You die if your health (in red) hits zero.
After dying, 3 seconds later a player will spawn at a random location.
Suicide reduces kills by one.

If you take damage, wait 5 seconds and your shields (in blue) will recharge.
After 10 seconds since taking damage,  your health (in red) will recover.

Hints:
 The Burst Rifle is a strong close range option, but you can't compete with the AI's.
 The micro rocket is consistent at long range if you can lead your shots, and the explosions do damage too!
 Approach your enemies from behind, they won't have a clue what's coming.
 Don't hang around player spawn areas, that's a great way to get "tele-fragged" by a Burst Rifle AI.
 The AI can and will look up to shoot at you! They don't do great with slopes though.
 If you break line of sight with a Burst Rifle AI, stay there! They'll forget about you soon.
